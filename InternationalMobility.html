                        As a student of ENSEEIHT, I have to achieve an <br>international mobility to be graduated.
                        <br>I plan to choose the destination coherently <br>with the languages I am working on :
                        <br><br>USA and UK are ideal because I would be <br>autonomous enough with my english level there.
                        <br><br>Japan is also very intersting for me, in this <br>place I would be able to improve my language a lot.
